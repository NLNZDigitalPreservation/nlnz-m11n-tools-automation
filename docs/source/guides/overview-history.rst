Overview
========

NLNZ M11N Tools Automation is a common set of automation classes providing tools for modernisation (M11N) automation.
The aim is to provide core functionality that is shared across other tools.

These automation classes and tools are also available for gradle builds in a automation tools plugin. Gradle builds
provide part of the platform of build and deploy automation. This plugin makes objects available for use in scripting.


History
=======

The codebase was originally developed at the New Zealand Qualifications Authority to help with some modernisation tasks
related to upgrading their existing codebases. Subsequently it was made available to the National Library of New
Zealand to help in some of their modernisation efforts for the Web Curator Tool (https://github.com/WebCuratorTool ).
Later it was also used in codebases related to SIP generation (https://github.com/NLNZDigitalPreservation ).

Project objectives
------------------

-   Meets the needs of the National Library of New Zealand
-   Possibly provide helpful functionality or example processing to other users and institutions.

The tool is open-source software and is freely available for the benefit of the international archiving community.
